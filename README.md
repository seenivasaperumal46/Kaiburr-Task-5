# üß† Kaiburr Task 5 ‚Äì Text Classification on Consumer Complaint Dataset

## üìå Project Overview
This project performs text classification on the [Consumer Complaint Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database) using Deep Learning (PyTorch). The goal is to classify complaints into the following categories:

| Label | Category                                        |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | Credit reporting, repair, or other              |
| 1     | Debt collection                                 |
| 2     | Consumer Loan                                   |
| 3     | Mortgage                                        |
